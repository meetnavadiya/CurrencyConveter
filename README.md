# CurrencyConveter
This is a simple and user-friendly Currency Converter application built with React.js. It enables users to convert between different currencies by fetching real-time exchange rates from an external API. The app allows users to select the currencies they wish to convert from and to, and input an amount to see the converted value instantly.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
